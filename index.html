> The universe is a wound in the mind of God.

---

> The sole purpose of non-existence is the regulation of existence.

---

> A mind that lacks form is over time exploited by more rigid minds.

---

> A desire for a life of freedom in a world that is drastically rigid can lead to severe pain.

---

> Every being acts motivated by the primordial chaos of the universe.

---

> The mind is a tool for denying the existence of God.

---

> God uses his undeniable existence to influence the ways in which he is being denied by the universe.

---

> Everything in the universe, including philosophy, is just a play of the primordial matter.

---

> The purpose of a so-called "messiah" is to shape the denial of God, often inadvertently resulting with some sort of organized religion.

---

> The quest of a so-called "messiah" is a quest for perfection according to his own internal standards.

---

> God is primordial chaos in constant motion.

---

> The residuals of God's movements have created stable life forms such as planets, plants and animals.

---

> Every action we take is motivated by our sheer idealisation of nothingness.

---

> Life is essentially a process of giving shape to the pain trapped inside of us.
